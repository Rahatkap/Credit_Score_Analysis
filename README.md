Analyzing credit scores for loan approval 
**Problem Statement:**
The traditional credit scoring process in banking lacks the efficiency and precision needed for accurate loan approval. Manual assessment methods often lead to biased decisions, resulting in potential financial risks for the bank. To address this issue, there is a pressing need for an advanced credit scoring system that incorporates machine learning techniques to enhance accuracy and reliability.

**Main Stakeholders:**
1. **Banks and Financial Institutions:** The primary stakeholders are the lending institutions seeking a more reliable and efficient credit scoring model to assess borrower risk accurately.
2. **Loan Applicants:** Individuals or businesses applying for loans are directly impacted by the credit scoring system. They are interested in fair and unbiased evaluations of their creditworthiness.

**Performed Activities:**
1. **Data Preprocessing Enhancement:**
   - Employed Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to enhance the reliability of the dataset by addressing class imbalance, resulting in a more robust training set.

2. **Utilized Diverse Classification Models:**
   - Implemented a spectrum of classification models, including Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forests, KNN, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, XGBoost, and ensemble methods.
   - Systematically compared key performance metrics such as confusion matrix, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), accuracy, and F-1 score to evaluate the efficacy of each model.

3. **Tableau for Transparent Visualizations:**
   - Employed Tableau to construct intricate visualizations that foster a transparent and data-centric methodology in the credit scoring process.
   - These visualizations provide a clear understanding of the model's decision-making process and contribute to the interpretability of the credit scoring system.

**Results:**
   - Following rigorous evaluation, the Random Forests model emerged as the most effective, showcasing the highest accuracy of 97%.
   - The ensemble approach of Random Forests not only demonstrated superior accuracy but also exhibited robust performance across various metrics, indicating its potential as a reliable credit scoring tool.
